Many techniques have been developed in order to increase the detection accuracy rates of lung cancer in CAD systems.
This comparative study will elaborate difference between 4 strategies based on 3 different classifiers (SVM & KNN & XGBOOST) and Wavelet transformation by itâ€™s all families as a Feature Extraction.
The proposed system was tested using a public data set (JSRT) that consists of 247 chest radio- graphy that contains 154 nodule and 93 non-nodule images

1. classify CXRs without lung extraction

2. classify CXRs with lung extraction

3. Nodule Detection in CXRs without lung extraction 

4. Nodule Detection in CXRs with lung extraction
